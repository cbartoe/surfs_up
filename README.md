# Surf's Up! : A Location Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this specific analysis is to examine temperatures in both June and December on the island of Oahu, Hawaii as supplement to previous reports on weather. Using measuremenst from all available weather stations on Oahu, the temperatures for the months of June and December have been extracted and statistical analysis was performed. 

## Results
The weather in Oahu is fairly homogenous year round. With its proximity to the equator being about that of Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, it stays almost exclusively in the 60's to 80's year round.  

### June Temperatures

As we can see here, the Average temperature in Oahu during the month of June is 74.9 degrees Farenheight with a standard deviation of 3.25 degrees and a range of 64-85 degrees. This shows that the temperature is relatively stable and warm in the summers.

### December Temperatures

For December, we see that the mean temperature is 71.0 degrees Farenheight with a standard deviation of 3.7 and a range of 56-83 degrees. With a median of 71, we can see that there is little to no skew and that temperatures are moderate. 

### Comparisons
The major differences between weather on the island of Oahu during June and December are as follows:
- The Average temperature is slightly lower in the winter, being 71 degrees in December vs 74.9 degrees in June. 
- Temperature lows in the winter do drop a bit to 56 degrees from 64 in the summer month.
- The spread of temperatures is a bit larger in December with the standard deviation beign 3.74 vs the 3.25 in June. 

## Summary
This all taken into consideration, the temperature differences do not appear significant enough to prevent purchases of ice cream or surf boards, being as though temperatures will average above 70 degrees nearly year round. This information is not the only important information however. The temperature analysis does not take into account the months of Jan-Mar, which for northern hemisphere coutnries tend to be the coldest of the year. There very well may be cold snaps in those months that impacrt business. It is important to be aware of other climate differences based on regions of the island may be of import. The weather around mountains and large bodies of water could contribute to areas of focused rain or wind on the same island or even issues with ocean currents that could create decreased ability for surfers to congregate near the store. Other factors may also impact the profitability of a business like this in the area. For instance, seasonal weather effects or natural disasters like hurricanes could create problems. Given the information we have at present, the weather does not seem to be a risk or hurdle in the success of this shop.
